                        <li><span>End of 2021 - today</span>
                            <p>I got interested in IT. I started to study various technologies and directions mainly:
                                Python, QA, web-development. In the end, I chose web-development in MERN stack and began
                                to study it diligently.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>2018-2021</span>
                            <p>I started a business in the field of apartment and commercial premises renovation. It was
                                quite an interesting experience. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>2016-2018</span>
                            <p>
                                During this period, I worked in Kyiv in various positions: call center, investment
                                analyst, investment consultant, realtor, b2b sales manager and, finally, a builder.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>2015</span>
                            <p>It was a year of travel abroad. I spend about 3 months in Poland, making pizza &#127829;,
                                then traveled around Europe, working not quite legally in various positions. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>2012-2014</span>
                            <p>I started working as an accountant. It was a good period of calculations, taxes and some
                                interesting financial frauds.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>2012</span>
                            <p>This year I decided that I was fed up with studying the ancient program and boring
                                subjects at the university, I said to myself "I need a break"</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>2011</span>
                            <p>At that time, I decided that I needed a job and started working in some Japanese
                                restaurant. And YES, I really know how to cook sushi and some other Japanese dishes.
                                &#x1f61c;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>2010</span>
                            <p>It was a time of great change. Finally I finished school. My grades were not bad, but 3 -
                                "9" separated me from getting the gold medal: music, drawing and chemistry. It was a
                                little sad.
                                I entered the Kyiv State Economic University named after V. Hetman at the Faculty of
                                International Economics and Management. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>2000-2010</span>
                            <p>About the school period, I think, everyone can talk for a long time, but due to the fact
                                that this is a resume, I must glorify myself, so I must admit that I was regularly sent
                                to almost all city and regional Olympiads, and I even had good results.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>2000</span>
                            <p>It happened, I finally went to school</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>1996-2000</span>
                            <p>
                                It was a real village childhood. During this period, every nettle within a radius of 3
                                km was destroyed with sticks, every dog ​​was chased, every ball was pierced, 2 bicycles
                                were broken into rubbish. &#128520; </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><span>1996</span>
                            <p>My parents finally graduated from the university and moved to a small town in the
                                Vinnitsa region. They had to take with them a two-year-old catastrophe named Maxim, they
                                had no choice...</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>I was born in Kharkov. At that time, my parents were studying at the medical university,
                                and it seems to me that just studying seemed a little boring to them and they urgently
                                need a child. But they didn't know what was really waiting for them.. </p>
